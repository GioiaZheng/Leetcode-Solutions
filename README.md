# **LeetCode Solutions Repository**

Curated, well-documented **Python 3** solutions for a growing set of LeetCode problems. Each folder contains a clear explanation (`README.md`) and an implementation (`solution.py`) so this repo can serve as a reusable algorithm notebook.

---

## **Repository Layout**
- `####-problem-name/` — individual problems with an explanation and `solution.py`.
- `0000-notes/` — consolidated reference notes (moved from the old `notes/` path).

---

## **Notes**
- [`binary-search.md`](0000-notes/binary-search.md) — boundaries, partitions, and monotonicity tricks for binary search.

More note files will be added under `0000-notes/` alongside new solutions.

## **How to Use**
- Open any problem folder to read the explanation and run `solution.py` locally.
- Keep an eye on `0000-notes/` for reusable templates and pattern summaries as they are added.
