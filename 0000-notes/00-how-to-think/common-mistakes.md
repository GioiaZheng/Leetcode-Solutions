# Common Beginner Mistakes in LeetCode  

This note is written for beginners who feel:

- “I’ve solved many problems, but new ones still feel hard”
- “I recognize the problem, but I can’t solve it myself”
- “I always assume I’m just not smart enough”

Most of the time, the problem is **not intelligence** —  
it is **how you practice**.

---

## 1. Mistake #1 — Thinking “I understand” means “I can solve”

This is the most common trap.

You read a solution and think:
> “Ah, that makes sense.”

But understanding a solution is **passive**.  
Solving a problem is **active**.

### The real test

After reading a solution, ask yourself:
- Can I write it again **from scratch**?
- Can I explain *why* each step exists?
- Can I adapt it to a similar problem?

If not, you did **not** truly understand it yet.

---

## 2. Mistake #2 — Memorizing code instead of patterns

Beginners often try to remember:
- exact loops
- specific variable names
- clever tricks

This does not scale.

What you should remember instead:
- problem shapes
- invariant ideas
- thinking templates

Example:
❌ “Use two pointers with these exact steps”  
✅ “Maintain a valid window while expanding and shrinking”

---

## 3. Mistake #3 — Jumping to algorithms too early

Many beginners do this:

1. Read problem
2. Immediately think: “DP? Sliding window? Binary search?”
3. Panic

This skips the most important step: **understanding the task**.

Correct order:
1. Understand input & output
2. Rephrase the problem
3. Identify constraints
4. Then consider algorithms

Algorithms come **last**, not first.

---

## 4. Mistake #4 — Ignoring why wrong ideas fail

When your idea doesn’t work, beginners often:
- delete it
- forget it
- move on

This is a waste.

Every wrong idea answers an important question:
> “Why doesn’t this approach work?”

That knowledge prevents future mistakes.

Always ask:
- What assumption was wrong?
- Which constraint did I violate?

---

## 5. Mistake #5 — Solving without reflection

Solving a problem is only **50% of learning**.

The other 50% is reflection.

After finishing a problem, beginners often:
- submit
- move on immediately

Instead, you should pause and ask:
- What was the key insight?
- Could I recognize this pattern earlier next time?
- What fooled me at first?

Without reflection, experience does not turn into skill.

---

## 6. Mistake #6 — Doing problems in random order

Random practice feels productive but is inefficient.

Why?
- You never build momentum
- You never reinforce patterns
- Every problem feels new

A better approach:
- group problems by topic
- practice similar patterns together
- notice repetition

Pattern recognition comes from **structured repetition**.

---

## 7. Mistake #7 — Overusing Dynamic Programming

DP is attractive because it feels powerful.

But beginners often:
- force DP into simple problems
- write overly complex solutions
- get lost in states

DP should be a **last resort**, not a default.

If:
- a one-pass solution exists
- greedy reasoning works

Then DP is unnecessary.

---

## 8. Mistake #8 — Being afraid of brute force

Beginners think brute force is “bad”.

It is not.

Brute force:
- helps you understand the problem
- gives you a correctness baseline
- reveals optimization opportunities

A slow correct idea is always better than no idea.

---

## 9. Mistake #9 — Comparing yourself to solution writers

LeetCode solutions are:
- polished
- optimized
- written after many failed attempts

You only see the **final product**, not the struggle.

Comparing your first thoughts to their final code is unfair.

---

## 10. Mistake #10 — Practicing without a goal

“Just doing problems” is vague.

Better goals:
- “I want to master sliding window”
- “I want to recognize binary search on answer”
- “I want to stop overusing DP”

Clear goals turn random effort into progress.

---

## 11. A healthier practice loop (recommended)

Use this loop for each problem:

1. Read and rephrase the problem
2. Attempt a solution (even if wrong)
3. Compare with a correct approach
4. Identify the key pattern
5. Write a short summary

This loop builds **transferable skill**, not just submissions.

---

## 12. Final reassurance

If you feel stuck, confused, or slow —  
that usually means you are learning **the right things**.

Skill does not grow linearly.  
It grows after confusion.

And confusion is not failure — it is progress in disguise.
